### Multi-Class-Customer-Ticket-Classification-using-Fine-Tuned-GPT-3.5-Turbo


Chatbots can sometimes struggle to understand customer issues. One of the main reasons is that they're trained on general text, missing the specific language of the company and customers.

This problem can be solved by Generative AI powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning LLMs on custom datasets, we can unlock benefits like enhanced accuracy, reduced bias, tailored solutions, and most importantly data security.

I have fine-tuned OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo LLM to tackle multi-class customer ticket classification in the banking domain. Using a focused dataset of banking tickets, I trained the model to recognize different types of issues, even with imbalanced data.

The results are Impressive! The fine-tuned model achieved 100% accuracy for classifying main issue categories and 90% accuracy for subcategories. This means faster resolutions, happier customers, and a significant boost to customer service efficiency.

Note: Some company names are available in the dataset, it is used just for educational purposes, but no bad intentions against those companies, apologies.
